Bank Credit Policy 2024:
1. Applicants with a Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio above 40% are considered high risk.
2. Employment history of less than 2 years requires a co-signer.
3. Loan grades E, F, and G are only eligible for secured loans.
4. If an applicant is a 'Renter' and has a DTI > 30%, extra scrutiny is required.
